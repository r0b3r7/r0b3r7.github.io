    <h2>DevOps is more than you think</h2>
    <p>When we hear the term "DevOps", most of us immediately think of technologies such as automation, continuous integration or continuous deployment. All of that in the context of DevOps often refers to processes like automatic code testing, deploying software updates, or real-time application monitoring - but for me DevOps is something more. Of course, the technical aspect of this culture is crucial, no doubt about it. For instance, in one of my projects, implementing automatic tests after each change in the main code branch allowed for immediate error and inconsistency detection. In another, automatic deployment enabled us to continuously deliver new features to users without waiting for significant updates, maintaining full backward compatibility and not blocking future changes. However, over the years of my experience, I concluded that DevOps is much more than just tools and processes. For me it's a philosophy that impacts organizational culture, collaboration, and most importantly, the success of the executed project. This philosophy assumes that the entire organization (or the part dedicated to the project) works as one unit, where everyone, regardless of their main goal, is committed to continuously delivering value. As a result, DevOps has the power to transform the entire organizational structure, making it more flexible, responsive, and focused on objectives and, consequently, customers.</p>
    
    <h4>DevOps is not just technology</h4>
    <p>Modern technology accelerates our world, but in itself is not a guarantee of success. As I mentioned, many of us, when thinking of DevOps, often mistakenly associate it exclusively with its engineering/technical approach. However, what made DevOps so popular and effective in organizations is its human aspect and, in particular, the work culture behind this approach. Based on my experiences, I have often encountered situations where there was a strong emphasis on technology because it's significant, catchy in terms of recognition, great to boast about in recruitments, and encourages people, etc. But at the same time, human relationships and team communication were entirely ignored, leading everyone involved in the project to see only their boundary and not want to see beyond. This naturally resulted in more errors, delays, and misunderstandings. When we decided to adopt the DevOps philosophy, we started by building communication bridges between teams and emphasized common goals. As a result, not only did the technology begin to work more smoothly, but the team atmosphere also improved, translating into higher productivity, efficiency, and even innovation. Therefore, while tools and processes are essential in DevOps, its heart lies in people and a culture of collaboration.</p>

    <h4>My experiences with DevOps</h4>
    <p>I've always believed that our experiences shape our perspective and the value we bring to the world. Over the years of working in the tech industry, I've had the opportunity to experience various methodologies and approaches, but DevOps in particular has stuck with me for a long time and most importantly it has transformed my thinking about software development.
      I remember one of my first projects where the initial misunderstanding of the DevOps concept led to some challenges. Instead of focusing on collaboration, the team focused on tools. As a result, even though the technology worked efficiently and we used all the available novelties in this field, a lack of communication was hitting the eyes. Only when we turned our attention to culture and values did we begin to see the real benefits of DevOps. Every team member began to get interested in almost every element of the delivery process, which eventually led to the delivered system increments being more accurate with every cycle, containing fewer errors, and most importantly, arriving much faster. Here, we could talk about an organically developed approach, which in the philosophy of DevOps, is called "shift left" (but I admit, I didn't know such a concept existed at that time).
      I think the most important lesson I've learned from my DevOps experiences is the value of continuous improvement. Regardless of how well processes or tools work, there's always room for improvement. Instead of resting on one's laurels, DevOps has taught me the values of reflection, analysis, and striving for even better solutions.
      These reflections show that DevOps is not just a set of practices but primarily a mindset that can benefit not only tech teams but the entire organization.

    <h4>DevOps as the key to business success</h4>
    <p>In the era of digital transformation, where market success depends on speed, innovation, and adaptability, the philosophy I'm trying to advocate here has proven to be an invaluable ally. But what makes this approach so revolutionary for the business world?
      Let's start with innovation. Who among us hasn't faced the challenge of introducing a new product to the market in a relatively short time? The traditional approach would require months of tests, reviews (sometimes some approvals etc.). But thanks to the DevOps culture, of course supported by agile project management, we can focus on continuous integration and delivery. We can start with a product in the form of a minimum viable product, and with a developed working culture and tools that serve us, we can successively and flexibly deliver new functionalities.
      Then we have flexibility. Changing market conditions, new technologies, and growing customer expectations mean that organizations need to be flexible and ready for rapid adaptation. By applying DevOps practices, we have the ability to quickly adjust to customer feedback and make product changes in real-time. Instead of sticking to rigidly fixed plans, we can continually evaluate the market and adjust our tactics and strategy accordingly.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, understanding DevOps in business terms means recognizing its value beyond just technology. It's a philosophy that places great importance on people, culture, and continuous improvement. In this digital era, the ability to innovate quickly, adapt to changes, and maintain customer-centricity is crucial for business success. This makes DevOps not just a tech trend but a driving force for modern businesses.</p>
