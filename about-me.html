    <h2>_About me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Robert and it's really nice that you dropped by!</p>
    <p>A bit about me: I've been closely connected to the IT and technology world for almost 30 years and it's been my professional daily routine for the last 15. I started my commercial career as a classical web technology programmer (php+js+html+css), gradually increasing the level of challenge, starting with small websites and ending up with high-performance systems that are exposed to high traffic and process large amounts of data. After a while, I became involved with the technical aspect of the advertising world, which quickly turned into a fascination with big data technologies, high performance, and scalability of systems.</p>
    <p>I have always worked with programmers, architects, and people with very strict but always open minds, which after a while opened my interest in effectively managing the established order. I started my management career quite a while ago, but to this day it is an experience that I continue to develop and from which I draw a lot of useful knowledge.</p>
    <p>Currently, the IT world is so wide and dynamically developing in different directions that it is difficult for me to answer the question of which area of this field I am most closely related to. Nevertheless, approaching my daily challenges purely binary, it will definitely be DevOps Engineering, Cloud Computing and the broadly understood Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</p>
    <p>My latest project, perfectly combining and grounding my technical and management knowledge, are the MBA studies with specialization in Cybersecurity Management that I started a few month ago.
